# arm-control-matlab
## Features
- matlab based simulation environment
- rigid/flexible joint robot dynamics
- trajectory, control algorithm testbed

## Simulator
1. Peter Corke's Robotics ToolboxEdit (rtb)
 - Rich features in robot algorithm
 - But, dynamics simulation is slow
 
2. VREP
 - Rich models
 - Easy to use
 - c++, matlab, python, ros
 - Fast simulation than rtb
